# Foreword

After seeing how bad my emulators[1,2] perform on the Raspberry PI[3]
, I've decided to start developing a binding to the Broadcom
VideoCore[4] API in order to introduce #golang to the beauties of
hardware acceleration on this device.

https://github.com/remogatto/videocore

The package will implement bindings to the following libraries:

* EGL
* OpenGL ES
* OpenVG
* OpenMAX

It's a long work. I'll appreciate your contribute and/or interest!
